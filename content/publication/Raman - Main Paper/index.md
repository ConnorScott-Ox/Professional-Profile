abstract: The molecular genetic classification of gliomas, particularly the identification of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, is critical for clinical and surgical decision-making. Raman spectroscopy probes the unique molecular vibrations of a sample to accurately characterize its molecular composition. No sample processing is required allowing for rapid analysis of tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of Raman spectroscopy to rapidly identify the common molecular genetic subtypes of diffuse glioma in the neurosurgical setting using fresh biopsy tissue. In addition, classification models were built using cryosections, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections and LN-18 (IDH-mutated and wild-type parental cell) glioma cell lines.
