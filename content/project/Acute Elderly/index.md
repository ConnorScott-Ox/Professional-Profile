For 6 months I volunteered in this NHS ward. My primarily goal was to ensure all patients were
comfortable and happy with their stay. I would frequently join ward rounds and sit down with
patients and discuss how they were feeling/discussed what we could do to make their stay more comfortable on top of just being a friendly face for them to talk to.

I routinuely took vitals and recorded them in the patient's notes.
