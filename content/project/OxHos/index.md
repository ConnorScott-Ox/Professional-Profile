Oxford Hands-On Science (OxHOS) is a student-run society based in Oxford. We believe that science is fun and relevant to everyone. We spread our enthusiasm for science to children and their families by taking a range of hands-on experiments into schools and public venues, with helpful undergraduate and post-graduate student volunteers explaining the science behind them. We enourage everyone to be curious and excited about science, using experiments that are interactive, entertaining, and sometimes surprising.

OxHOS was founded in partnership with Cambridge Hands-On Science (CHaOS) who have been running science Roadshows for over 10 years. This means we have lots of experiments covering a broad range of science subjects, and lots of experience in how to run a great event.

The first ever OxHOS Roadshow took place in September 2015, and since then we have taken our interactive experiments on the road to schools and public venues every summer.
