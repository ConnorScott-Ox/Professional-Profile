<b>Mission & scope</b>
<br>
Frontiers in Neuroimaging is a multidisciplinary journal focused on expanding research on the physiological principles underlying typical and atypical brain functions to decrease the global burden of brain disorders.
<br>
Led by Prof Francisco Xavier Castellanos Grossman (School of Medicine, New York University New York, USA) and Pedro Antonio Valdes-Sosa (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, China), Frontiers in Neuroimaging aims to advance research on the emerging role brain imaging plays in neuroscience.
<br>
Topics include, but are not limited to:
<br>
*brain imaging methods
*clinical neuroimaging
*computational neuroimaging
*neuroimaging analysis and protocols
*neuroimaging meta-analyses
*neuroimaging and neuromodulation
*neuroimaging for cognitive neuroscience
*perception and attention neuroimaging
*population neuroimaging
*social and affective neuroimaging.
<br>
In particular, the journal welcomes submissions which support and advance the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), notably 9: good health and Well-being, promoting our understanding of brain health.
<br>
Frontiers in Neuroimaging is committed to deepening our understanding of population neuroimaging. This can be achieved through in-depth understanding of studies across extensive cohorts to enhance cross-level integration from neuroimaging-based systems and more. It aims to do so by allowing unrestricted access to articles, and communicating scientific knowledge to researchers and the public alike, to enable the scientific breakthroughs of the future.
