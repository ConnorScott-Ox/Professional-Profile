For 4 Months I acted as a volunteer in this Unit. My task ranged from taking vitals such as blood pressure/o2 saturation to
feeding and clothing patients. I would travel with nervous or disabled patients to their external GP 
appointments and would relay information from doctors between departments.
<br>
I routinuely took vitals and recorded them in the patient's notes.
