<b>London International Youth Science Forum</b><br>
<br>
The London International Youth Science Forum (LIYSF) is a two week residential student event held at Imperial College London & The Royal Geographical Society, with lecture demonstrations from leading scientists, visits to world class laboratories and universities combined with cultural interaction, with 500 students aged 16-21 years old from 70 countries. <br>
<br>
Groups of 23 of these students (pictured) visit our Department. The latest group came from 14 countries including UAE, Australia China, India, Israel, Sweden, Taiwan and New Zealand. Our Breathe Oxford lab got them involved in some interactive activities related to their research into the brain and breathing. The students also had the chance to visit our neuropathology lab, and learned about reaction times and Parkinsonâ€™s from our NeuroMetrology Group.
