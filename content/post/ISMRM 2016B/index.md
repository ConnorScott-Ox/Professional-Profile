summary: In this work we compare a single flip angle and dual flip angle approach to overcome B1 inhomogeneities in DW-SSFP data of post mortem human brain at 7T. Both approaches were designed and optimized to achieve optimal CNR with whole brain coverage. The single flip angle approach displayed slight improvements in orientation estimates; however, the dual flip angle approach is being further investigated as a potential source of microstructural estimates with little to no cost in orientation.<b><i>Abstract and Poster -  International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) 24th Annual Meeting & Exhibition, Session - Diffusion, May 07th - 13th, 2016.</i></b>
