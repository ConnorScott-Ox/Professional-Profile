abstract: The BigMac dataset is a unique, to be open access resource that includes extensive MRI and densely sampled microscopy data acquired in a single, whole macaque brain. However, the microscopy data currently only informs on the fibre orientations in 2D, precluding 3D reconstruction of the microscopy connectome. Through precise co-registration and joint modelling of the diffusion MRI and microscopy data, this work aims to reconstruct the microscopy fibre orientations in 3D. This will facilitate future determination of the ultra-high resolution, whole brain, microscopy-inspired connectome, which we expect will provide neuroanatomical insight, as well as play a vital role in validating and advancing techniques for in vivo tractography.

summary: The BigMac dataset is a unique resource that includes extensive MRI and densely sampled microscopy data acquired in a single, whole macaque brain. However, the high-resolution microscopy currently only informs on the fibre orientations in the 2D plane of sampled slides, precluding 3D reconstruction of the microscopy connectome. Here we use precise co-registration and joint modelling of diffusion MRI and polarised light images to reconstruct the microscopy fibre orientations in 3D. This will facilitate future determination of the whole brain, microscopy-inspired connectome, which we expect will provide neuroanatomical insight, and play a vital role in validating and advancing invivo tractography.
